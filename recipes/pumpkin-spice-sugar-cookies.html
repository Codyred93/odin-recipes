    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If a homemade pumpkin pie and a soft sugar cookie had little cookies of their own, well, let these speak for themselves. Add your favorite seasoned nuts if you wish. I happened to have had some caramelized sugar I had previously made and I crushed this up and added to the top of some of the cookies just before baking.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat butter and 2 cups sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Add eggs and vanilla; beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Add flour mixture to butter mixture and beat until flour is completely incorporated. Cover dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray baking sheets with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/4 cup sugar into a shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets. Moisten the bottom of a glass with water and dip the glass in sugar. Gently flatten each drop of cookie dough with the bottom of the sugared glass.</li>
        <li>Bake cookies in the preheated oven until set, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
